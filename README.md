Project Title: Component Management Web Application

Project Description:
Designed and developed a comprehensive web application for a manufacturing unit to manage and optimize the production of various components. The application utilized a graph data structure to represent component relationships and quality indices. Key features and achievements include:

Created a user-friendly UI with multiple pages to facilitate component categorization, quality assessment, research progress tracking, and future development planning.
Defined a robust data schema to model components, including their IDs, names, child components (with weights in parent quality index), and parent components.
Developed a rich text input mechanism using react-quill for detailed component descriptions and notes.
Implemented a report generation system for each page, allowing users to access summarized data and, in some cases, provide input to enhance product information.
Successfully generated dummy data for component quality indices and utilized it to demonstrate the application's functionality.
Utilized skills in React.js, data modeling, and front-end development to deliver a user-friendly and efficient tool for the manufacturing unit.
This project showcased my ability to design and develop complex web applications, create and manage data structures, and provide user-friendly interfaces for data visualization and interaction. It also demonstrated my proficiency in using modern web development technologies and tools, including React.js and rich text editors. The project contributed to enhancing the manufacturing unit's component management processes and overall efficiency.
